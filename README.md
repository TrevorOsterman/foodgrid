# foodgrid.

foodgrid. is a web app for use when you're so hungry that you can't be bothered with clicking around on Yelp or Google Maps. Just type in the location you'd like to search in (city+state, address, or ZIP) and you'll be provided with photos from the highest rated restaurants in the area.

Once you've found what looks the best to you, just click to be brought directly to the business' Yelp page. It's that simple.
